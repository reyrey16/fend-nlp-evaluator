# NLP Project

## By: Reynaldo Linares

## Overview
This project will be using the meaningcloud.com/sentiment-2.1.org API to create an asynchronous web app which will dynamically update the UI with fetched data along with data entered by the end user. The API anaylzes the web article that will be provided by the user and provide some basic sentiment data about it. 

## Dependencies

This project requires the use of Webpack and all it's dependecies. All requires a working API key for the server to run properly

## Features

In this project, I got a chance to implement and play around with the following features of webpack and the added modules:
-- Webpack
-- Sass styles
-- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
-- Creating layouts and page design
-- Service workers
-- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

## Usage

Enter the URL of the article you want analyzed and the webpage will update in a few seconds with the results of its anaylsis. I hope you enjoy using the site as much as I had fun making it. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to send me an email. Thanks!
